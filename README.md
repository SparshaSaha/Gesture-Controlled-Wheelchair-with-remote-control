# Gesture Controlled Wheelchair with remote control and Complete GPS tracking

## Sub Repos

### Server 
The Web Server is built to store the location history of the Wheelchair and thus help in remote location tracking from the Android Application.

### Android Application
**Sridhar will write this**

### Hardware
The hardware consists of the heart and soul of the wheelchair. It is a raspbery Pie driven model that does all the (REAL :P) work.
It does all the work that we can see anyway(Just Kidding).

It comprises the DIY model(the damn skeleton I mean)made from a Mechanix piece, and the raspberry pi(the Mr. Brain) which takes care of what the wheelchair does(read thinks :P...*No there is no AI in this yet*).
